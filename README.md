## How I Created the Game

This entire game started as a way for me to learn coding for the first time, especially with Python — which was both easier and harder than I thought. I originally wanted to make just one mini-game but got carried away and made 3 in one (still a work in progress).  

Inspiration came from many initial YouTube tutorials that helped me solve technical issues. Hope you have fun playing! More updates will be given shortly.  

**Shoutout to Tech With Tim for the inspiration and files **
